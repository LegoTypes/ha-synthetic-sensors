# YAML fixture for test_cross_sensor_collision_handling.py integration tests
# Used by: test_cross_sensor_collision_resolution_integration
# Test cases covered:
# - Cross-sensor reference resolution with entity ID collisions
# - Unique ID collision handling and re-assignment
# - Reference resolution to collision-handled entity IDs

version: "1.0"
