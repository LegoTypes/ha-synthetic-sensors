# YAML fixture for test_cross_sensor_collision_handling_unit.py unit tests
# Used by: yaml_with_collisions fixture
# Test cases covered:
# - Entity ID collision scenarios between sensors
# - Different unique_ids with same suggested entity names
# - Collision detection and resolution testing

sensors:
  # These sensors have different unique_ids but same suggested entity names
  power_sensor_a:  # unique_id but will try to become sensor.power_sensor
    entity_id: sensor.span_panel_instantaneous_power
    formula: state * 1.1
    metadata:
      unit_of_measurement: W
      device_class: power

  power_sensor_b:  # different unique_id but also tries sensor.power_sensor â†’ collision!
    entity_id: sensor.circuit_a_power
    formula: state * 2
    metadata:
      unit_of_measurement: W
      device_class: power

  total_power:  # References both sensors by their YAML keys
    entity_id: sensor.kitchen_temperature
    formula: power_sensor_a + power_sensor_b  # Both references should resolve correctly
