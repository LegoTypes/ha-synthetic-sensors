# Test Scenario 6.3: Nested Attribute References
# Purpose: Test nested attribute reference patterns
# Expected: Nested attributes resolve correctly
# Validation: Nested attribute access and mathematical operations work

sensors:
  # Test nested attribute references
  nested_attr_refs:
    entity_id: sensor.span_panel_instantaneous_power
    formula: state * 0.25  # Main result = 250 cents/h (assuming 1000W backing entity)
    attributes:
      # Nested attribute reference - calculate power from voltage and current
      power_calculation:
        formula: state.voltage * state.current  # Nested attributes for power calculation
