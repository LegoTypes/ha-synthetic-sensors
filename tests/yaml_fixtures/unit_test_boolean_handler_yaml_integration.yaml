# YAML fixture for boolean handler integration tests
# Used by: test_boolean_handler_integration.py
# Test cases covered:
# - Boolean logic sensors using Python operators (and, or, not)
# - Entity state comparisons in boolean expressions
# - Verification that symbolic operators (&&, ||, !) are not used

version: "1.0"
