# YAML fixture for test_integration.py integration tests
# Used by: test_yaml_based_integration_public_api
# Test cases covered:
# - YAML-based integration using public API only
# - Global settings with device identifier
# - Sensors with attributes (literal and calculated)
# - Full sensor configuration with metadata

version: "1.0"
