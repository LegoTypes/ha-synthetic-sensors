"""Test attribute formula structure preservation during config creation.

This test ensures that attribute formulas with the structure:
    grace_period_active:
      formula: within_grace

Are properly preserved and not flattened to:
    grace_period_active: within_grace

This was a bug where config creation was flattening AttributeConfig structures.
